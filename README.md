# Dotfiles!

Who doesn't like a good set of environment dotfiles.

These set up useful env settings and config for zsh, micro, kubernetes, tmux, and probably 
other things I've forgotten. They _should_ work on OS X and Linux.

## Setup

Roughly:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/underthink/dotdot.git ~/.dot
echo 'source ~/.dot/init.zsh' >> ~/.zshrc
```
